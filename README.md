# qbands-tf

Calculation of energy band formation on a four-well quantum integrable model. The model contains interaction and hopping terms, whose "strength" are controlled respectively by the parameters "U" and "J".

The code also contains a brief application of deep-learning, which is capable of reproducing the non-highly-degenerate parts of the spectrum with a fairly simple neural network.

By running the code, the output will be both the quantum-mechanically-evaluated energy bands and the prediction (and training/testing statistics) of the neural network.

Please, refer to arXiv:2004.11987 for more details on the model, such as its importance in the context of interferometry and metrology.
